## Analysis
Filtered trafficdown to HTTP POST requests and saw this:
```
POST /js/php/email.php HTTP/1.1
from=agentx@x.com&subject=secret&msg=aXRzbm90cmVhbGx5YXNlY3JldA==
```
Decodes to 'itsnotreallyasecret' but that is not the flag. Looking at all the web requests I notice requests to
atast-ctf.net and see a download of a PDF file. The PDF is password protected, but luckily we know the password.
Once we unlock the PDF, we get our flag.
